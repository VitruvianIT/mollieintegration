<h1>Mollie Payment Integration into Dart</h1><br>
<ul><li>Create Order</li>
<li>Pay Order</li>
<li>Listen to transaction</li>
<li>On success run PHP script</li>
<li><b>Follow scheme to return</b></li></ul>

I needed a Dart integration of Mollie and created it myself because there was none found.<br>
In this example I only provided Bancontact but others are easily integratable.
The tricky part is the handling when the payment succeeds by its scheme and I added comments to make things clear.
